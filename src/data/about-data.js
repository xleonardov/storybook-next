        I have a passion for creating and maintaining design systems and have
        been working in this space for several years. I am currently leading the
        development of the Pantheon Design System. In my previous role at The
        Ohio State University, I was a co-founder of their first university-wide
        design system.

        With my diverse background in development, design, photography, and
        project management, I am a strong proponent of building and leading
        cross-functional teams.
