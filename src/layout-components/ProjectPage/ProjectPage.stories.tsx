      <p>
        I co-created the Buckeye UX design system with a small team of designers
        and developers at The Ohio State University. The system is built with
        React and TypeScript, and it is used to build and maintain the
        universityâ€™s web properties. I was the tech lead and a designer on the
        project, and I was responsible for the architecture, documentation, and
        implementation of the system. I also worked with stakeholders to ensure
        that the system met the needs of the university and its users.
