Web Content Management is a site building platform for The Ohio State University. It is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications. It is a living, breathing document that is constantly evolving as new patterns emerge and best practices evolve.

The name may be bland (due to university service naming conventions), but the platform is a dynamic, flexible, and powerful tool that has been used to build hundreds of websites across the university. It is a Drupal-based platform that is designed to be a starting point for any website, and can be customized to meet the specific needs of any project.
