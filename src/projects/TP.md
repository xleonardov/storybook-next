I transformed the Ohio State University Transportation & Parking Services website from an outdated, hand-coded site to a modern (for 2011), CMS site using Drupal.

By using a content management system, I was able to create a site that was easy to update and maintain by the content owners and subject matter experts instead of relying on a web developer to make updates.

While working as a graphic designer and web developer for the department, I proposed the redesign project to T&P leadership and then led the project from start to finish.

I was responsible for the design, development, and project management of the site build. I worked with the T&P team to understand their needs and goals, and then I created a site that met those needs — which included informational pages for each garage and bus route, and an interactive parking permit selection tool.

The new design adhered to the university's brand guidelines and was much more user friendly and accessible than the previous site. It was also responsive, which was not a given at the time.
